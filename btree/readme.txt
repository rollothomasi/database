The btree I build in this project is a little different from the demo,
while the demo will choose its previous child of parent(N) as N'(only if there is a prevoius child,which means N is not the first)
I choose the next child of parent(N) as N',treating the last child as a special case instead of the first,
so the results may be different from the demo's,but also reasonable.

I write two scripts here with the name of myscript.txt and myscript1.txt
Here we use positive numbers as insert method,and negative numbers for delete method like:
1 3 5 7 9 4 -3 -5 11 13 15 17 19 23 21 25 27 //picture1
29 31 33 35 37 //picture2
39//my picture3
-35//my picture4
pictures can be refered to in the test report,and more descriptions are also in the report with the picture.
